Share a link to execute a test suite
==============

Pressing this button:

<form>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" aria-label="Left Align" ><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star" aria-hidden="true">Link</span></button>
</form>

you will see a message with the url that starts the test suite execution with the configured custom params and execution name
This could be helpful when a story is in development process and your test is ready to be executed, so you can create a test suite related to the history,
set custom params, execution name and then share the link to de developer which is responsible about the history implementation
